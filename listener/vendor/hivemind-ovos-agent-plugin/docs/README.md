  with defaults and behaviour notes.
- [`message_flow.md`](message_flow.md) — end-to-end traces of how a client utterance
  reaches OVOS skills and how responses are routed back, including the multi-client
  isolation guarantee.
- [`development.md`](development.md) — local development, testing, and release
  workflow.
- [`policy.md`](policy.md) — OVOS-specific policy plugin, mutation classes, and
  the built-in `OVOSAgentPolicy`.
